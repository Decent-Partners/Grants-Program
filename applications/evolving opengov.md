### **TL:DR**



* A treasury requiring a simple majority (51%) of votes is a specific funding mechanism.
* Majority rule is definitively not the best way to encourage and support innovation.
* Innovation should be understood as a process containing many evolving and interdependent phases.
* Each phase optimises for specific outcomes but remains part of a cohesive whole.
* People, cultures and projects fit into different phases at different times.
* This post presents an outline for understanding and framing these phases.


### **How Innovation Works**


    _Innovation_ is not an individual _phenomenon_ but a collective, incremental and _messy network phenomenon_ - Matt Ridley, How Innovation Works.

Current arguments within ecosystems focus attention on large ‘public good’ treasuries.

Whilst influential, these entities are just one component in what can be understood as a phased innovation process that should be structured through the full life cycle of R&D, productisation and go to market, with motivations, oversight, rewards and ROI contingent on the phase and the entity involved.

Lets try and break this down:

   </td>
   <td>R&D

   <td>R&D
   </td>
   <td>Directed
   </td>
   <td>Independent researchers, who may or may not have patrons, are recruited by research organisations to continue their work in a more formal setting, with some oversight. Researchers are selected based on perceived alignments with an organisation’s values, mission or operations. Researchers sacrifice some independence, but gain greater support - primarily financial. They will be managed in some way, with their work assessed and valued by relevant committees. This form of R&D is most commonly found within universities, governments and highly specialised or experimental industries. For many researchers a combination of support, alongside highly prized access to proprietary resources and proximity to other researchers whose work they find interesting leads their decision making. Generally this work also maps to gaining valuable qualifications or certifications such as a phD and producing cited work in relevant publications that establishes status amongst peers.

This feedback loop is the beginning of the productisation of theoretical research into concepts that have a path towards commercial exploitation. .

This may also be called an Alpha release.

This may also be called a Beta release.

### **Substrate’s emerging innovation support phases and functions**

**Phase 1a - Independent R&D**

Independent thinkers are hard work. They are difficult to manage (they don’t want to be).

They do not want funding, deliverables or any oversight. They would rather be poor.

They want to be left alone to follow their own interests that may or may not later prove useful.

Innovation functions required:



* A bunch of weirdos
* Publishing platforms
* Discussion spaces
* Digital and IRL experiences to meet other independent thinkers.

**Phase 1b - Supported R&D**



* Weirdos → independent thinkers
* Some out there ideas

Innovation functions required:



* Mechanisms to provide support via patronage that doesn’t request anything in return.
    * Donations
    * Subscriptions

**Phase 1c - Directed R&D**



* Independent thinkers → focused researchers
* Some out there ideas with some practical potential
* Mechanisms, social structures and funding processes direct this thinking towards tangible impact

Innovation functions required:



* Treasury Burn (0.2% of treasury).
* Web3 Foundation Grants

**Phase 1d - Applied R&D**



* Focused researchers → experimental builders
* Out there ideas → practical potential

Innovation functions required:



* Mechanisms, funding structures and processes
    * Treasury Burn (0.2% of treasury).
    * Kusama treasury R&D tracks (with fixed budget limits)

**Phase 2a - Reference implementation**



* Experimental builders → Developers and Product Managers
* Practical potential → System design

Innovation functions required:



* Mechanisms, structures and processes
    * Treasury Burn (0.2% of treasury).
    * Kusama treasury R&D tracks (with fixed budget limits)

**Phase 2b - Proof of concept**



* Product managers → Product teams
* Practical potential → MVP

Innovation functions required:



* Mechanisms, structures and processes
    * Treasury Burn (0.2% of treasury).
    * Kusama treasury R&D tracks (with fixed budget limits)

**Phase 2c - Minimum Viable Product**



* Product teams → Startup teams
* MVP–> user traction

Innovation functions required:



* Mechanisms, structures and processes
    * Treasury Burn (0.2% of treasury).
    * Kusama treasury R&D tracks (with higer budget limits)

**Phase 3a - Commercial venture**



* Startup team → Go to market
* User traction → commercial impact

Innovation functions required:



* Mechanisms, structures and processes
    * Treasury Burn (0.2% of treasury).
    * Kusama treasury R&D tracks (with higer budget limits)
    * Kusama treasury startup track (with higher budget limits)
    * Outside funding partners - per[ Introducing an alternative financing strategy, structure and partnership for maximising the potency of Kusama's treasury - #3 by rich](https://forum.polkadot.network/t/introducing-an-alternative-financing-strategy-structure-and-partnership-for-maximising-the-potency-of-kusamas-treasury/3146/3)


## **Summary**

To encourage an innovative culture, we need to understand just how to identify, support and scale that culture through a phased approach that approaches talent, focus and outcomes independently but as part of a cohesive whole.

- references to conversations you might have had related to this project with anyone from the Web3 Foundation.

## Development Roadmap :nut_and_bolt:

This section should break the research development roadmap down into milestones and deliverables. To assist you in defining it, we have created a document with examples for some grant categories, including research [here](../docs/Support%20Docs/grant_guidelines_per_category.md). Since these will be part of the agreement, it helps to describe *the deliverable we should expect in as much detail as possible*, plus how we can verify that deliverable. Whenever milestones are delivered, we refer to this document to ensure that everything has been delivered as expected.

Below we provide an **example roadmap**. In the descriptions, it should be clear how your project is related to Substrate, Kusama or Polkadot. We *recommend* that teams structure their roadmap as 1 milestone ≈ 1 month.

> :exclamation: If any of your deliverables is based on somebody else's work, make sure you cite it. If your research contains software artifacts in the same situation, make sure you work and publish *under the terms of the license* of the respective project and that you **highlight this fact in your milestone documentation** and in the source code if applicable! **Teams that submit others' work without attributing it will be immediately terminated.**

### Overview

- **Total Estimated Duration:** Duration of the whole project (e.g. 2 months)
- **Full-Time Equivalent (FTE):**  Average number of full-time employees working on the project throughout its duration (see [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full-time_equivalent), e.g. 2 FTE)
- **Total Costs:** Requested amount in USD for the whole project (e.g. 12,000 USD). Note that the acceptance criteria and additional benefits vary depending on the [level](../README.md#level_slider-levels) of funding requested.

### Milestone 1 Example — Literature Review and Data Collection

- **Estimated duration:** 1 month
- **FTE:**  1,5
- **Costs:** 8,000 USD

> :exclamation: **The default deliverables 0a-0e below are mandatory for all milestones**.
