## **Project Overview 📄**

This application is a response to [Action Research for OpenGov](https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program/blob/c8617cf42df90fe07a5bfa5c348e889b290dc544/docs/RFPs/action_research_opengov.md)

Some content within this post is sourced from [Structuring support across a full innovation cycle](https://forum.polkadot.network/t/structuring-support-across-a-full-innovation-cycle/3170) on the Polkadot forum.


### **Overview**

_Evolving OpenGov - structuring support through a full innovation lifecycle._

Whilst OpenGov has released an incredible amount of energy and recruited many to its cause, the system is still extremely primitive.

Although there are now many groups attempting to coordinate chaos in Kusama and Polkadot, the focus is on _what_ and _who_ to fund - with analysis of spending falling into domain based approaches - rather than a more nuanced assessment of _how_, _when_ and _why_ to fund - or indeed curtail certain initiatives. 

Whilst influential, large ‘public good’ treasuries are just one component in what can be understood as a phased innovation process that should be structured through the full life cycle of R&D, productisation and go to market, with motivations, oversight, rewards and ROI contingent on the phase and the entity involved.

To encourage an innovative culture, we need to understand just how to identify, support and scale that culture through a phased approach that approaches talent, focus and outcomes independently but as part of a cohesive whole, evolving technical, social and meritocratic structures as we go.

The aim of this initial paper is to set context for, and a hopeful path towards a more structured approach to innovation in the ecosystem - beginning at the lowest levels of creative endeavour.

It will include an outline for understanding and framing innovation phases alongside a strategic framework for implementing novel processes and rethinking existing orthodoxy through OpenGov and the myriad technical, financial and cultural resources available in the ecosystem. 

Beginning in Kusama, results can be applied directly by technical upgrades of OpenGov by The Fellowship as well as via specifically programmed on-chain organisations and suggested developments in off-chain UX/UI via associated RFPs.

The emphasis is on experience gained through over five years of direct participation in on-chain governed and funded networks Edgeware, Kusama, Polkadot and Decred.

As both an early investor in Polkadot, grass-roots contributor, council member (edgeware), parachain kickstarter (kabocha), on-chain business owner and someone attempting to onboard established creative talent and institutions, OpenGov has brought a strange mix of excitement and frustration. 

Excitement at witnessing the emergence of a new form of digital governance alongside the bootstrapping of capital and frustration at witnessing the squandering of resources, the predictable rise of culture wars and ultimately a lack of meaningful innovation beyond the core technical levels. 

The hope is that this initial research paper, and hopefully those that follow can unify strategic insight with directly applicable evolutions to the core governance machinery of Polkadot, introducing a more human centric model that blends the best of technocratic, democratic and meritocratic ideals.

Ultimately we see this strategic foundation as a vital component in releasing the undoubted potential of the ecosystem towards more focused and productive goals.


### **Project Details**

Everyone wants ‘innovation’ - but few discuss the underlying conditions required for its appearance. 

_Innovation is not an individual phenomenon but a collective, incremental and messy network phenomenon - Matt Ridley, How Innovation Works._

Although impossible to control and shape completely, there are ways to foster an innovation culture - firstly by understanding it as a process containing many evolving and interdependent phases.

Each phase optimises for specific outcomes but remains part of a cohesive whole.

People, cultures and projects fit into different phases at different times.

As an example, let’s try and break this down:

   <td>Independent researchers, who may or may not have patrons, are recruited by research organisations to continue their work in a more formal setting, with some oversight. Researchers are selected based on perceived alignments with an organisation’s values, mission or operations. Researchers sacrifice some independence, but gain greater support - primarily financial. They will be managed in some way, with their work assessed and valued by relevant committees. This form of R&D is most commonly found within universities, governments and highly specialised or experimental industries. For many researchers a combination of support, alongside highly prized access to proprietary resources and proximity to other researchers whose work they find interesting leads their decision making. Generally this work also maps to gaining valuable qualifications or certifications such as a phD and producing cited work in relevant publications that establishes status amongst peers.

This initial paper aims to be the first in a series of structured documents - and will focus on a strategic foundation for incubating an innovation culture, therefore it will remain fairly high level. 

It is primarily a qualitative, rather than quantitative paper - where data is used, sources will be referenced.

The final publication will be hosted at the Decent Partners website, on Github and broken down into more digestible forms on Twitter and we will discuss the insights and strategy via media including podcasts and existing ecosystem initiatives such as AAG. 

We aim for publication 1 month after the approval of this grant. 


### **Ecosystem Fit**

This initial paper is focused on empowering innovation in Kusama as part of an ongoing grass-roots R&D process that also involves [Krievo’s organisational structures](https://virto.network/blog/1ksm-1dao-create-community-kreivo/), soon to launch [Brale branded stablecoin integration](https://rfc.decent.partners/t/funding-brale-integration-with-kusama-assethub/57) on AssetHub in c. 16 weeks and the [experimental Kabocha parachain](https://forum.polkadot.network/t/introducing-kabocha-an-experimental-kusama-parachain-incubated-by-the-edgeware-community/327) where holders will govern pledged IP in the form of NFTs on Asset Hub via XCM.

It also precedes the arrival of a range of creative projects, talent and financial partnerships - that will be reliant on and contributing entities to a more structured approach to innovation.


### **Example innovation support phases and functions**

If we apply the prior framework to the current ecosystem we can begin to structure the process.

**Phase 1a - Independent R&D**

Independent thinkers are hard work. They are difficult to manage (they don’t want to be).

They do not want funding, deliverables or any oversight. They would rather be poor.

They want to be left alone to follow their own interests that may or may not later prove useful.

Innovation functions required:



* A bunch of weirdos
* Publishing platforms
* Discussion spaces
* Digital and IRL experiences to meet other independent thinkers.

**Phase 1b - Supported R&D**



* Weirdos → independent thinkers
* Some out there ideas

Innovation functions required:



* Mechanisms to provide support via patronage that doesn’t request anything in return.
    * Donations
    * Subscriptions

**Phase 1c - Directed R&D**



* Independent thinkers → focused researchers
* Some out there ideas with some practical potential
* Mechanisms, social structures and funding processes direct this thinking towards tangible impact

Innovation functions required:



* Treasury Burn (0.2% of treasury).
* Web3 Foundation Grants

**Phase 1d - Applied R&D**



* Focused researchers → experimental builders
* Out there ideas → practical potential

Innovation functions required:



* Mechanisms, funding structures and processes
    * Treasury Burn (0.2% of treasury).
    * Kusama treasury R&D tracks (with fixed budget limits)

**Phase 2a - Reference implementation**



* Experimental builders → Developers and Product Managers
* Practical potential → System design

Innovation functions required:



* Mechanisms, structures and processes
    * Treasury Burn (0.2% of treasury).
    * Kusama treasury R&D tracks (with fixed budget limits)

**Phase 2b - Proof of concept**



* Product managers → Product teams
* Practical potential → MVP

Innovation functions required:



* Mechanisms, structures and processes
    * Treasury Burn (0.2% of treasury).
    * Kusama treasury R&D tracks (with fixed budget limits)

**Phase 2c - Minimum Viable Product**



* Product teams → Startup teams
* MVP–> user traction

Innovation functions required:



* Mechanisms, structures and processes
    * Treasury Burn (0.2% of treasury).
    * Kusama treasury R&D tracks (with higher budget limits)

**Phase 3a - Commercial venture**



* Startup team → Go to market
* User traction → commercial impact

Innovation functions required:



* Mechanisms, structures and processes
    * Treasury Burn (0.2% of treasury).
    * Kusama treasury R&D tracks (with higher budget limits)
    * Kusama treasury startup track (with higher budget limits)
    * Outside funding partners - per[ Introducing an alternative financing strategy, structure and partnership for maximising the potency of Kusama's treasury - #3 by rich](https://forum.polkadot.network/t/introducing-an-alternative-financing-strategy-structure-and-partnership-for-maximising-the-potency-of-kusamas-treasury/3146/3)

Our target audience is The Fellowship and core community contributors as well as new builders entering the ecosystem. 

This work also constitutes a kind of ‘thinking in public’, as we seek to create foundations for supporting a new generation of creative talent.

The project seeks to address the ecosystem’s thorniest problems - that of driving up the collective intelligence, innovation and ultimately the productivity of Kusama’s network.

There are a number of research organisations emerging in the ecosystem - [OpenGov.Watch](http://opengov.watch) is perhaps the nearest comparable, though their work focused predominantly in Polkadot, whereas we believe Kusama offers fertile territory to experiment with the next generation of OpenGov.

Outside of Polkadot, a similar on-chain strategy / research outfit would be [Other Internet](https://otherinter.net/) whose work has been incredibly influential in the wider crypto-industry.

## **Future Plans**

The final publication will be hosted at the Decent Partners website, on Github and broken down into more digestible forms on Twitter and we will discuss the insights and strategy via media including podcasts and existing ecosystem initiatives such as AAG. 

We believe this work has the potential to kickstart an on-chain research collective in Kusama and ultimately be funded sustainably by a new on-chain structure - likely connected to the upcoming arrival of Brale into Kuama AH.


## **Additional Information ➕**

**How did you hear about the Grants Program?** 

Being in/around the ecosystem. 

To date all of my work has been self-funded with a small amount of funding coming from a series of Edgeware grants.

You can access previously delivered on-chain proposals in Edgeware [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gu-5YklgTp2f3eDm25Mp6xu2kefP_fp0EW1xSdZD7LY/edit?usp=sharing). 

Previous proposals have been submitted to Kusama OpenGov - each was on its own a form of applied research as I sought to understand the emerging culture, technical aspects and conventions by pressing the buttons of token holders.

See full list [here](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/user/DecentPartners).
